# Recombination and the Coalescent

Tutorial based on notes by Mikkel Schierup

The recombination rate is determined by rho=2Nc. In the animation, recombination events are marked as blue nodes (in contrast to the green nodes of coalescent events).
Set n=5, and rho=1. Press recalc and study the animation. Does any recombination events occur? If not, try again. How many recombination events do you expect to see? Try a total of 25 times and write down the number of recombination events in each case. What does the distribution look like?

Look at a couple of simulations in more detail. Study where in the sequence, recombination events occur. Can you find examples that different part of the sequence have different most recent common ancestors (marked in green) at different time points?

Try to press the trees window pane. Here it is possible to study each of the different trees over the sequence. How many different trees are there and how does this relate to the number of recombination events? Try to find examples of each of the following recombination types:

Recombination changing the topology of the tree

Recombination changing the branch length but not the topology of the tree

Recombination that does not change the tree

What is the total number of each of the tree types during the 5 replicate runs? How does that match with theory.

Try setting rho=2 and n=10
How many recombinations occur now?
At which time do different parts of the sequence find a most recent common ancestor?
What is the time until the first part of the sequence finds a most recent common ancestor (calculate the average over 5 replicates). At which time have all the different parts of the sequence found a most recent common ancestor (average over 5 replicates)? Compare this time with the time to most recent common ancestor without recombination


Try setting rho=5 and n=20, how many recombination events occur now? How many different most recent common ancestors are there over the sequence now?
