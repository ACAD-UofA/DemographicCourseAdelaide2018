Tutorial based on notes by Mikkel Schierup

The recombination rate is determined by rho=2Nc. In the animation, recombination events are marked as blue nodes (in contrast to the green nodes of coalescent events).
Â Set n=5, and rho=1. Press recalc and study the animation. Does any recombination events occur? If not, try again. How many recombination events do you expect to see? Try a totl of 25 times and write down the number of recombination events in each case. What does the distribution look like?

Look at a couple of simulations in more detail. Study where in the sequence, recombination events occur

Can you find examples that different part of the sequence have different most recent common ancestors (marked in green) at different time points?.
